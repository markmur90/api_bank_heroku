Getting started
To get started with our Premium Bank API, talk to your banker first. He or she needs to activate the API feature on your Memo Bank workspace.
Once your banker has granted you an API access, you can then setup your authentication using our web interface. To do so, navigate to the API section of your Memo Bank workspace.
Owners and administrators can create applications and manage their permissions. They can also invite collaborators to an application, allowing them to manage certificates, IP allow-lists and webhooks.
Once an application and a certificate have been created, you will have three pieces of information allowing you to authenticate requests on the API:

    a certificate and its SHA256 thumbprint;
    a secret code;
    a cryptographic private key.


Authentication
Our authentication is based on JSON Web Token (JWT) and JSON Web Signature (JWS).
No matter which coding language you are using, there should be a library to handle the cryptographic part for you. All you need is to feed it the right header and payload claims.
In the JWT header:

    alg must be RS256, as we require a RSA-SHA256 signature.
    typ must be JWT.
    x5t#S256 is the SHA256 thumbprint of the certificate, which you can find on the user interface.

In the JWT payload:

    sub must be the method of the request, followed by a space and the full path, including query params.
    aud must be the domain on which you do the request, e.g. api.memo.bank.
    iat must be the timestamp at which you created the token. Note that we accept only 5 seconds of difference with the server time, to mitigate clock skew.
    jti must be a unique identifier for the token. It must be different for each request and respect the UUID format.
    sec must be the secret information you obtained during the setup process on the user interface. This is a custom claim, not covered by the JWT specification.
    dig#S256 must be a base64url_encoding(sha_256(body)), to be provided only if the request has a body, so for example it is not necessary on GET requests (see base64url_encoding). This is a custom claim, not covered by the JWT specification.

The JWT must then be signed with the private key you generated during the setup (see Getting started), and included in the HTTP headers of the request, as a standard bearer token Authorization: Bearer <token>.

}


Idempotent requests
Our Premium Bank API supports idempotency for safely retrying requests without accidentally performing the same operation twice. This is useful when an API call is disrupted in transit and you do not receive a response. For example, if a request to create a transfer does not go through due to a network connection error, you can retry the request with the same idempotency key to guarantee that only the single transfer originally attempted is created.
To perform an idempotent request, provide an additional Idempotency-Key request header. We recommend using a V4 UUID. In case the API call fails with a network error, or responds with a 5XX, 409 or 429 status code, we expect the caller to perform retries with the same Idempotency-Key header until it responds differently. For any other response code, especially other 4XX errors, there is no point in attempting retries, as we will always send the same result.
When a previous response is replayed, the response is sent with an additional HTTP header Idempotent-Replayed: true.
Idempotency keys will persist in the API for 24 hours. If an original request is still being processed when an idempotency key is reused, the API will return a 409 Conflict error (which is safe to retry).
Subsequent requests must be identical to the original request or the API will return a 422 Unprocessable Entity error. We do not support setting an idempotency key on GET and DELETE requests, as these requests are inherently idempotent.

curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.memo.bank/v1/transfers \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer ***' \
  --header 'Idempotency-Key: 19b390d1-e7d4-4e27-abe2-49cac9b41ba1' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{...}'


Errors
Our Premium Bank API uses standard HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of requests. Codes in the 2xx range indicate success; codes in the 4xx and 5xx ranges indicate errors. The format of error messages is unified, and can be distinguished by their code key. The message is a plain English explanation of the problem.
{
  "code": "error_code",
  "message": "Example error message.",
}


Versioning and backwards compatibility
Our Premium Bank API is versioned by path (/v1/...). When we introduce breaking changes, we will increase this version number. We will of course continually make backward-compatible changes without increasing the version number.
Examples of things we do not consider breaking include:

    Adding new API resources.
    Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods.
    Adding new properties to existing API responses. We will occasionally move response fields in the API, and will continue to return the existing field in its previous location, while removing it from this documentation.
    Changing the order of properties in existing API responses.
    Changing the length or format of opaque strings, such as object IDs, error messages, and other human-readable strings. Strings that are marked as const or enum in this documentation will not change.
    Adding new EventType or ResourceType enum values for webhooks.
    Adding new TransactionSource enum values for transactions.


Rate limiting
We enforce a rate limit on how many HTTP requests can be made in a given period. When the limit is reached, our Premium Bank API will return an error 429 Too Many Requests.
To allow you to handle this rate limiting in a programmatic way, the following headers are sent along every response:

    RateLimit-Limit: total number of available requests between two quota resets;
    RateLimit-Remaining: number of available requests until the quota is reset;
    RateLimit-Reset: time remaining (in seconds) until the quota is reset.


FAQ
How do Transactions differ from Transfers and Collections?
Transfers and collections are types of Transaction that you can initiate through the API. They have dedicated endpoint resources in order for you to follow their lifecycle which is very detailed. On the other side, Transactions allows you to follow all transactions lifecycle even the ones that you did not initiate through the API (incoming transactions, card transactions, etc). Since Transfers and collections are a subset of Transactions, some webhooks will be triggered at the same time (for instance transfer_confirmed and transaction_confirmed) and you can use either.
Is creating a beneficiary or mandate mandatory before initiating transactions?
Creating a beneficiary for transfers or a mandate for collections is not mandatory. When initiating a new transfer or collection, you will provide the counterpart data directly in the initiating endpoint, we will auto-create it and you will be able to see it in the interface. For next transfers/collections, you will continue to provide the counterpart data and we will match it with any beneficiary/mandate that exists in the interface.
How can I reconcile a return with its original transfer or collection?
When you received a return transaction, we will notify you through a transaction_confirmed webhook. Then you will need to get the transaction, check the source type to determine if it is a collection_outgoing_return or transfer_outgoing_return, then use the returned_collection_id / returned_transfer_id field to reconcile with the original ID of your collection/transfer.
How can I differentiate transaction types?
To differentiate transaction types, you can use the type contained in the source object.
What happens if my system is unavailable when Memo Bank sends webhooks?
We will retry each webhook independently 8 times following an exponential backoff. The intervals between retries are: 3 min, 10 min, 30 min, 1 hour, 6 hours, 12 hours, 1 day, 3 days. After that, we will stop retrying but you will be able to manually trigger a retry through our interface.
When using the instant_if_available strategy, will Memo Bank retry a failed instant transfer as a standard transfer?
No, we will not retry failed instant transfers as standard transfers. However, we recommend you do so. If an instant transfer fails, retrying or using a standard transfer is often the best course of action. instant_if_available will only ensure that we will process your transfer as standard if the counterparty bank does not support instant transfers.
What is the difference between failed and cancelled transaction statuses?
Your transaction will end up in cancelled status when you choose to cancel the transaction either with our API or our interface. In some cases, your transaction could end up in cancelled status as well due to internal processing reasons, but most of the time for processing reasons your transaction will end up in failed status. Both statuses are definitive and if you are not at the origin of the cancellation, you could consider them equivalent in your developments.
Are webhooks triggered for transactions not initiated with the API?
Yes, they are. Webhooks are triggered independently of the channel you choose to use to initiate your transaction.
Can I retrieve the URL of the mandate request signature flow?
No, it is not possible for the moment. As of today, we only support sending the URL to your clients by email.
Is it possible to initiate a payment via API and have it validated by a human on the interface?
No, it is not possible. Our API is designed for automated, human-free transactions at scale.
How can I stay informed about the latest API updates?
We provide a RSS feed that you can subscribe to. It is available at this URL when you click on the Get Updates button at the top of the page.


Sandbox
We offer a sandbox, allowing you to integrate your application with our API in a controlled environment. Get in touch with your banker to create an access.
All the endpoints described in this specification can be used on the sandbox. We also offer some sandbox only endpoints, allowing you to simulate incoming transactions.
The base URL for the sandbox API is https://api.sandbox.memo.bank.
To get to know more about our sandbox behavior and features, please read our dedicated help page.

IBANs
IBANs are identifiers for bank accounts. There are two types of IBANs at Memo Bank:
    Main IBANs, which acts as a primary identifier for a bank account. There is exactly one main IBAN per bank account. You cannot delete it. When an account is closed, its main IBAN remains active only for incoming transactions, which will be automatically rerouted to the main account.
    Virtual IBANs, which are aliases for the main IBAN. They can be created, deactivated, and reactivated at will. When the account they are attached to is closed, they get reattached to the main account.
All operations on IBANs are synchronous and effective immediately, meaning that you can use a new IBAN to send or receive money right after its creation.

Transactions
Transactions are any debit and credit operations on an account.

Transactions lifecycle
Note that the status of the transaction indicates whether or not it affects the account’s available balance. debit transactions impact the balance as soon as they reach the authorized state. credit transactions impact it only when their status turns to confirmed.

Transfers

Transfers are SEPA transfers, including SEPA standard transfers and SEPA instant transfers.

They can be initiated asynchronously, one by one or in bulk.

They have a similar lifecycle compared to transactions but note that there are some minor differences for the canceled and failed states.

Cancel a SEPA transfer
DELETE /v2/transfers/{id}

This endpoint allows you to cancel a SEPA transfer before its execution has actually started.

Concretely a transfer can be canceled while in scheduled or authorized state. However, attempting to cancel a transfer in authorizedstate may result in a transfer_not_cancelable error if the transfer has already been sent to the creditor's bank. For the same reason, instant transfers cannot be canceled at all.
Path parameters

    id string(uuid) Required

Create bulk transfers
POST /v2/transfers/bulks

This endpoint allows to create up to 5000 transfers with a single call. It acts exactly as if you called the POST /v2/transfers endpoint 5000 times yourself, except you don't need to worry about rate limiting. It also allows you to get an aggregated state for this bulk.

This endpoint does not perform the transfers synchronously, a 200 OK response means the bulk will be handled in the near future. You can either poll the GET endpoint or use the webhooks to follow its progress.

Note that the completion of a bulk does not mean all transfers are settled, it only means the transfers were initiated (the equivalent of a call to POST /v2/transfers).

Collections are SEPA direct debit collections, including SEPA CORE direct debits and SEPA B2B direct debits.

To initiate a direct debit, a mandate signed by the debtor is required. You have the option to use our signature request workflow, which handles this signature, or you can choose to manage it yourself. Whichever method you select, you will only need to provide the mandate information when setting up the direct debit, not the signed document itself.

They can be initiated asynchronously, one by one or in bulk.

Unlike transfers, collections can only be scheduled for a date in the future. As a result, their lifecycle is also simplified.

Create bulk collections
POST /v2/collections/bulks

This endpoint allows to create up to 5000 collections with a single call. It acts exactly as if you called the POST /v2/collections endpoint 5000 times yourself, except you don't need to worry about rate limiting. It also allows you to get an aggregated state for this bulk.

This endpoint does not perform the collections synchronously, a 200 OK response means the bulk will be handled in the near future. You can either poll the GET endpoint or use the webhooks to follow its progress.

Note that the completion of a bulk does not mean all collections are settled, it only means the collections were initiated (the equivalent of a call to POST /v2/collections).

Webhook
Events

When something interesting happens on your Memo Bank workspace, such as a new Transaction being created, Memo Bank can reach out to your application so that you can take action (such as sending an e-mail alert about the transaction to your user) automatically.

The first step is to add a Webhook to your application in the API section of your Memo Bank workspace. As part of this, you will have to provide a URL on your own servers. Memo Bank will then send HTTPS requests to that URL when there is an activity on your Memo Bank workspace.
Consuming Events

Individual Events do not contain very much information on their own. This is by design, as the API structure can remain extremely stable and avoid difficult webhook migrations in the future as the Memo Bank API changes. If you need additional metadata, such as the amount of the Transaction in the above example, make a GET request to the API for that information. You can use the resource_type and resource_id to determine what resource to fetch from the API.
Failures and retries

If your application returns anything other than a 2xx HTTP status code, we will retry it up to 8 times with exponentially increasing backoffs. In your webhook endpoint implementation, we recommend you place inbound Events into your application’s own queuing system (such as Kafka, Resque, etc) for asynchronous event processing, and returning a 200 response from your endpoint as quickly as possible.
Securing your webhook endpoint (recommended)

Memo Bank will include an Authorization header in each webhook request. Inside of it, you will find Bearer <token> with the authentication token we provided when you created the webhook on the web interface. We recommend that you check this header and reject requests with invalid token, indicating a malicious request that would not have been issued by Memo Bank.

We also recommend that you restrict which IP addresses can call your webhook. Here is the list of our IP addresses:

    35.181.64.230
    15.236.178.243
    13.36.24.215
    3.78.51.103
    3.74.208.131
    3.122.142.56



Handle an event
POST https://webhook.example.com
Body Required

    id string(uuid) Required

    ID of this event. Must be used for idempotence: an event with the same ID can be sent multiple times in case of error, but should only be processed once.
    date string(date-time) Required

    Event creation date, in ISO8601 format.
    event_type string Required

    Type of event. We may add additional possible types over time; your application should be able to handle such additions gracefully.

    Values are account_created, account_updated, account_closed, attachment_created, attachment_deleted, collection_confirmed, collection_canceled, collection_failed, iban_created, iban_updated, iban_deleted, transaction_scheduled, transaction_authorized, transaction_confirmed, transaction_rejected, transaction_canceled, transfer_confirmed, transfer_canceled, transfer_failed, bulk_transfers_completed, bulk_collections_completed, mandate_signature_request_sent, mandate_signature_request_expired, mandate_signature_request_completed, or mandate_signature_request_deleted.
    resource_type string Required

    Type of the resource referenced by this event. We may add additional possible source types over time; your application should be able to handle such additions gracefully.

    Values are account, attachment, collection, iban, transaction, transfer, bulk_transfers, bulk_collections, or mandate_signature_request.
    resource_id string(uuid) Required

    ID of the resource referenced by this event.
